# Client-side files (Java)

Java EE web app usually generates an entry file `.jsp` instead `.html`, but for this tutorial let's just use `.html` for simplicity.

- `/`: `.html` (or `.jsp` for other projects)
- `/js`: `.js`
- `/css`: `.css`

Create these folders under `webapp` folder, the image below show it (after creating files on the next section)
