# Client-side files (.NET Core)

Typically, ASP.NET Core app serves files from `/wwwroot/` folder, so under that folder, let's organize like this:

- `wwwroot/`: Webpage files (`.html`)
- `wwwroot/js`: JavaScript files (`.js`)
- `wwwroot/css`: Cascade style sheet files (`.css`)

The image below illustrates our file and folder structure after creating them in the next section:
