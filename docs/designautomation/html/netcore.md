# Basic app UI

Let's start with the UI (HTML and JavaScript) files. Under **wwwroot** folder, create **bundles** and **js** folder.

## index.html

Under **wwwroot** folder create the **index.html** file with the following content:

[wwwroot/index.html](_snippets/modifymodels/netcore/wwwroot/index.html ':include :type=code html')

## ForgeDesignAutomation.js

Under **wwwroot/js** folder create the **ForgeDesignAutomation.js** file with the following content:

[wwwroot/js/ForgeDesignAutomation.js](_snippets/modifymodels/netcore/wwwroot/js/ForgeDesignAutomation.js ':include :type=code javascript')

The final result should look like:

At this point you can run your project, just hit **play**, the HTML interface should open, indicating that your project was created correctly. None of the buttons should work... let's move forward.
