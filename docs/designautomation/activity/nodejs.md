# Define an Activity (Node.js)

**Activity**

Now we will write endpoints for creating new activity and getting the existing activities, copy the following code into `DesignAutomation.js` file before the last line `module.exports = router;`:

[routes/DesignAutomation.js](_snippets/modifymodels/node/routes/DesignAutomation.3.js ':include :type=code javascript')

Now you can click on **Configure** (top-right), select the AppBundle, select the Engine and click on **Define Activity**, which should define and upload the appbundle and define the activity. The results panel (left-side) shows the respective ids. **All other buttons do not work yet**... let's move forward.
