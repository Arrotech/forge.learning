# Your first dashboard

This tutorial will guide you reading data and creating some charts. 

> For this tutorial you need an app with Viewer, for instance the [View your models](tutorials/viewmodels.md) or the [View BIM 360 & Fusion models](tutorials/viewhubmodels.md) tutorial. The Viewer is the same regardless where the file is hosted.
