# Running & Debugging (.NET Core)

The .NET Core ASP.NET project that we created on Visual Studio came without files, therefore when we start it, nothing runs. As our **forgesample** project now contains a `wwwroot/index.html` it will load it.

Visual Studio should recognize all browsers on the machine and list them to start your project. Just select one and click on the "play" icon. The browser should open with your start page.
