!> For a better experience, DO NOT use Visual code on this tutorial.

## Visual Studio Community 2017

If you are installing Visual Studio Community for the first time, make sure to select `ASP.NET and web development` workload for this tutorial. `.NET desktop development` worflow is need for **Design Automation** tutorial: **Modify my models**. Other **Workloads** are not required for this tutorial.

In case Visual Studio Community is already installed, go to **Add or remove programs** >> **Apps & Features**, find Visual Studio Community and click **Modify**, then select the workload (as shown below).

## Other flavors & older versions

> For this tutorial, we don't need Professional or Enterprise features :wink:

Older versions of Visual Studio use **Tools** (not workloads). This tutorial assumes 2017 version. For an existing older installation (e.g. Visual Studio Professional 2015), if web tools are not available, go to go to **Add or remove programs** >> **Apps & Features**, find Visual Studio and click **Modify**, then select as shown on the image below (the actuall naming may vary between versions).
